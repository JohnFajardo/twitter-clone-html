#README

I'm planning to build a Twitter clone. This is just the mock HTML, nothing to see here.

However, if you insist on checking it out, just clone it, run gulp and go to http://localhost:3000.

If a browser window doesn't open, make a quick edit on either the html or scss files and save. This will trigger Gulp into rebuilding everything and doing a browser reload.
